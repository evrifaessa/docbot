# docbot
Simple Discord bot that replies with the related documentation page when you call it.
It will likely mainly be used in the [FOSSBilling](https://fossbilling.org/discord) Discord server, but I'm planning to make it more extensible and customizable in the future.

Heavily inspired by the bot in Laravel's Discord server with the same name.

## How it works
* The bot is invited with minimal permissions, the permissions to read and send messages should be fine.

## How to use
Invite the bot now using [this invite link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1032269333973442600&scope=bot&permissions=2048) (the link only has "Send messages" permissions) or build and deploy it yourself.
