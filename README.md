# docbot
Simple Discord bot that replies with the related documentation page when you call it.
It will likely mainly be used in the [FOSSBilling](https://fossbilling.org/discord) Discord server, but I'm planning to make it more extensible and customizable in the future.

Heavily inspired by the bot in Laravel's Discord server with the same name.

## How it works
* The bot is invited with minimal permissions, the permissions to read and send messages should be fine.

# How to deploy

# Licensing
